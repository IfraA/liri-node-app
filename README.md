Liri (Node) App

In this assignment, I created LIRI, which is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Technologies used: JavaScript, Node, APIs

Takes the following commands through the Terminal:

node liri.js twitter [handle]- obtains last 20 tweets

node liri.js spotify [song]- obtains artist name, song name, album name, and a preview link

node liri.js ombd [movie name]- obtains movie title, year released, IMBD rating, rotten tomatoes rating, production country, language, plot, and actors
